## Introduction

**Problem - what is known?**

Cilia are evolutionarily conserved, crucial organelles that enable cells to perceive external environmental cues and generate various forms of movement. At their core, motile cilia are composed of a highly organized axoneme, typically exhibiting a 9+2 microtubule arrangement. The characteristic bending and beating of these cilia are powered by the ATP-dependent sliding motion of associated dynein motor proteins along these microtubules (Satir et al., 2014). This dynamic propulsion mechanism is fundamental for numerous life-sustaining processes, including locomotion in single-celled organisms, sperm motility essential for reproduction, the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain, and the efficient clearance of foreign particles from the respiratory tract. Understanding the intricate molecular machinery governing ciliary function is therefore critical for comprehending basic cell biology and various physiological processes.

**Contextualization**

Kinesin family member 6 (KIF6), a prominent member of the kinesin superfamily, has emerged as a crucial player in ciliary biology, with its functions only recently being elucidated. Mutations in KIF6 have been linked to significant developmental disorders, including scoliosis in zebrafish (Buchan et al., 2014) and hydrocephalus stemming from dysfunction of ependymal cell cilia and neurological developmental issues in mammals (Konjikusic et al., 2018; Takagishi et al., 2024). More recent investigations have further revealed KIF6's distinct roles in mammalian motile cilia, indicating its involvement in cargo transport along doublet microtubules to facilitate the rotational polarization of ependymal multicilia (Fang et al., 2024). This proposed transport function is strongly supported by recent *in vitro* findings demonstrating that KIF6, similar to other kinesin-9 family members (Demonchy et al., 2009; Ishii et al., 2024), can actively move along microtubules, suggesting its role in delivering essential factors for proper ciliary activity.

**Knowledge gap - what is not known?**

Despite the emerging recognition of KIF6's involvement in ciliogenesis, its potential role in intraflagellar transport (IFT), and its possible contribution to ciliary motility, the precise spatiotemporal regulation and underlying molecular mechanisms governing its function remain largely undefined. While KIF6 is expected to transport ciliary factors, critical questions persist regarding _when_ and _where_ KIF6 acts within the cilium, whether it transports specific cargo, and if so, the exact identity of such cargo. Consequently, the precise mechanisms by which KIF6 contributes to overall ciliary function and ultimately impacts essential cilia-dependent processes are yet to be fully deciphered. A comprehensive understanding of these fundamental aspects is therefore indispensable to advance our knowledge of ciliary biology.

**Definition and purpose of the study**

To address these critical knowledge gaps regarding KIF6's precise function and underlying mechanisms in ciliary biology, this study aimed to comprehensively elucidate the molecular role of KIF6 in flagellar formation and motility. Our objectives included investigating KIF6's function in Chlamydomonas through genetic analysis of flagellar motility mutants, generating KIF6 knockout (KO) mice for extensive phenotypic analysis, and functional investigation of KIF6 through the development of transgenic mice to determine its subcellular localization. We further sought to uncover its molecular interactions via comprehensive proteomic analyses. Moreover, to gain a multifaceted understanding, we employed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and tomography to meticulously characterize detailed structural alterations within KIF6 KO sperm, thereby providing insights into the overall impact of KIF6 deficiency and establishing evolutionary conservation of KIF6 function.

## Methods

**Population and sample - inclusion and/or exclusion criteria; reference to the informed consent form and approval by the ethics committee**

All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Experiment Committees of The University of Tokyo (Protocol No. Med-P22-053) and Chiba University, conducted in strict accordance with the Act on Welfare and Management of Animals (No. 105, 1973) and the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments (Science Council of Japan, 2006). KIF6 knockout (KO) mice were generated via CRISPR/Cas9 editing, with homozygous (KIF6-/-) mice exhibiting male infertility while heterozygous (KIF6+/-) mice were fertile. KIF6 rescue mice, expressing KIF6-EGFP-FLAG under the endogenous promoter, were also generated, and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice served as controls. All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and _ad libitum_ access to food and water. Inclusion criteria for all experiments included male mice aged 8-12 weeks, confirmed genotype, absence of illness, and normal body weight. Exclusion criteria encompassed visible abnormalities, failure to produce samples, technical errors, or extreme outlier values. Written informed consent was not applicable as this study used laboratory animals; however, all procedures adhered strictly to approved animal experiment protocols.

**Population and sample II - description of specific sampling subgroups or, when necessary, in-depth detailing of procedures connected to follow-up and losses**

Building upon the understanding of ciliary and flagellar function, genetically defined mouse cohorts were established for detailed analyses. Sperm motility analysis utilized WT (n=24), homozygous KO (n=11), and Rescue (n=10) mice, each contributing one cauda epididymal sperm sample. For ATP quantification, samples from WT (n=9 final, initially n=12), KO (n=9), and Rescue (n=9) mice were collected across three independent experimental days, ensuring all genotypes were represented to control for variability. Three initial WT samples were excluded due to technical errors (ATP values >20-fold below group median, suspected incomplete extraction/pipetting error). Proteomic analysis and co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry employed samples from WT (n=3), KO (n=3), and KIF6-EGFP-FLAG transgenic (n=3) mice. Fertility testing encompassed 482 mating pairs, following the exclusion of 181 initial pairs (27%) due to harem matings. KIF6-EGFP localization was assessed in testis sections from three transgenic mice. Throughout all experiments, animal health was monitored daily, and all sample collections meticulously documented. Exclusions are detailed in Supplementary Table S1; no animals were lost due to mortality or illness.

**Generation of KIF6 KO mice**

KIF6 knockout (KO) mice were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing system, adapting established methods similar to those described for _Odf4_ KO mouse generation (Ito et al., 2023). A single-guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed to target exon 1 (nucleotides 141-163) with the sequence 5'-ACCGTGCGGAAGCAGCAGCA-3' and a 5'-CCC-3' protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), and was synthesized _in vitro_ from specific oligonucleotides (forward oligo 5'-ACCGTGCGGAAGCAGCAGCA-3' and reverse oligo 5'-TGCTGCTGCTTCCGCAC). A CRISPR/Cas9 mixture containing 50 ng/μl sgRNA and 100 ng/μl Cas9 nuclease was microinjected into BDF1 pronuclear stage embryos, which were then transferred into pseudopregnant ICR female mice. F0 founder mice were screened via genomic PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the target region to identify indels. A homozygous +35 bp insertion, leading to a frameshift and premature stop codon, was identified as the predominant KO allele and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The absence of KIF6 protein or mRNA in homozygous KO (KIF6-/-) mice was subsequently verified by Western blotting or RT-qPCR analysis of testis extracts. While viable, homozygous KIF6-/- males exhibited complete infertility. These KO mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for at least five generations to ensure genetic homogeneity, and all genotyping was performed on genomic DNA extracted from tail biopsies prior to inclusion in experiments, thereby setting the stage for comprehensive phenotypic characterization.

**Generation of transgenic mice and rescue mice**

To investigate the in vivo function and localization of KIF6 within motile flagella, particularly in the context of male reproduction, transgenic mice expressing a KIF6-EGFP-3xFLAG fusion protein were generated. The methodology closely followed established protocols for pronuclear microinjection, similar to those previously described by Ito et al. (2023). As illustrated in Figure 3A, a plasmid construct was engineered comprising the full-length murine KIF6 coding sequence, fused in-frame with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and a triple FLAG (3xFLAG) tag. This entire coding cassette was subcloned downstream of the testis-specific *Calmegin* [9]) promoter to ensure targeted expression within germ cells. The successful establishment of these transgenic lines provided a crucial model for subsequent analyses of KIF6 localization and function within testicular cells and spermatozoa. Rescue mice were generated by crossing transgenic individuals with knockout (KO) individuals.

**Fertility Testing**

To evaluate the reproductive performance associated with KIF6, litter size was quantified for wild-type (WT), KIF6 knockout (KO), and KIF6 rescue (Rescue) genotypes. Male mice (8-12 weeks old) of each genotype were individually paired with proven fertile wild-type females (C57BL/6J, 8-10 weeks old) in a 1:1 ratio and co-housed for 2 weeks to 3 months, depending on the experimental design. The number of pups born per mating pair was recorded. Matings were excluded from analysis if multiple males were housed with a single female (harem matings) to avoid confounding effects. This fertility assessment provided a macroscopic measure of reproductive output, establishing a foundational understanding of overall reproductive capacity prior to more granular analyses of sperm function.

**Sample Collection and Preparation of Sperm**

To investigate the functional implications of KIF6 in flagellar motility, a comprehensive protocol for sperm motility analysis was established. Sperm were harvested from the cauda epididymis of adult male mice (8-12 weeks old) representing three distinct genotypes: wild-type (WT, n=24), KIF6 knockout (KO, n=11), and KIF6 rescue (Rescue, n=10). Following euthanasia by cervical dislocation, the cauda epididymis was immediately dissected and placed in pre-warmed (37°C) Toyoda-Yokoyama-Hosi (TYH) medium supplemented with 4 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. Sperm were then gently released by mincing the tissue with fine scissors and allowed to swim out for 30-60 minutes at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO₂ atmosphere. Subsequently, sperm suspensions were collected, diluted to approximately 1-2 × 10⁶ cells/mL with fresh TYH medium, and their concentration determined using a hemocytometer under phase-contrast microscopy (×400 magnification), preparing them for subsequent functional assessments.

**Motility Analysis System**

Building upon the foundational understanding of flagellar mechanics, sperm motility was quantitatively assessed using the Sperm Motility Analysis System (SMAS, version 3.0; DITECT Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as previously described (Ito et al., 2023). It comprised a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U phase-contrast microscope, Basler acA2040-180kmNIR camera, and custom SMAS software. Sperm suspensions (10 μL) were loaded into an 11 μm deep SMAS counting chamber (DP041125c, DITECT Co., Ltd.), maintained at 37°C. Simultaneous analysis of over 100 fields minimized concentration variations. Recordings (150 fps for 1 s, ×10 objective) were captured at 1920 × 1080 pixels (0.475276 μm/pixel). Trajectories were tracked (0.83 effective rate) and smoothed (13-frame moving average). Key motility parameters—VAP, VCL, VSL, LIN, STR, WOB, BCF, and ALH were calculated.

**KIF6-GFP Localization Analysis in Testis**

Beyond the functional assessment of sperm motility, detailed localization analysis of KIF6-GFP within testicular tissues was performed using both fixed and live imaging approaches. For fixed tissue analysis, perfusion fixation with Bouin's solution was employed, followed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections as previously detailed (Ito et al., 2023). KIF6 localization was specifically visualized using an anti-GFP antibody, targeting the fusion protein. Live imaging investigations focused on intact seminiferous tubules and epithelial cells squeezed out from them. A suite of advanced microscopy systems facilitated these observations, including a Zeiss LSM-880 confocal microscope, a Zeiss Lattice-lightsheet7 system, and Olympus FV3000 and FV4000 microscopes, particularly for high-resolution imaging of seminiferous tubules.

**Sperm Proteomic Mass Spectrometry**

To gain comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying KIF6 function and its impact on sperm biology, a comparative proteomic analysis was conducted on sperm isolated from wild-type (WT) and KIF6 knockout (KO) mice. Sperm samples, prepared as described for motility analysis (refer to P10), were subjected to rigorous protein extraction using a urea-based lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Total protein concentration was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Subsequently, proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin to generate peptides. The resulting peptide mixtures were then analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on a high-resolution instrument (e.g., Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer coupled with an Easy-nLC 1200 system). Raw mass spectrometry data were processed using specific software (e.g., MaxQuant) for protein identification and label-free quantification, yielding extensive datasets of differentially expressed proteins crucial for subsequent statistical assessment.

**Cryo-Electron Tomography of Sperm**

To elucidate the detailed ultrastructural organization of sperm flagella in the context of KIF6 function, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) was employed. Mature sperm samples from both wild-type (WT) and KIF6 knockout (KO) mice were prepared for high-resolution imaging. Specifically, sperm were gently demembranated to enhance visualization of internal axonemal structures and subsequently cryo-preserved via plunge-freezing into liquid ethane, adopting a protocol analogous to that established by Yamaguchi et al. (2022) for ciliary doublet microtubules. Tomographic data acquisition concentrated on the distal regions of the sperm flagellum, a critical area for flagellar mechanics and wave propagation. For structural analysis, multiple axonemal doublet microtubules were extracted from the tomograms, and their intrinsic 48 nm periodic repeats were subjected to subtomogram averaging. This technique allowed for the high-resolution reconstruction and comparative assessment of conserved structural motifs between the WT and KO genotypes, providing a basis for subsequent quantitative evaluation.

## Results

**Infertility Phenotyp in KIF6 KO male**

To assess the functional consequences of KIF6 deficiency on fertility, we performed mating experiments. KO homozygous (KO(-/-)) mice showed severe infertility, with an average litter size of 0.78 pups per mating pair (n=482 mating pairs after excluding harem matings), compared to 4.31 pups per mating pair in WT mice (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) (Figure 3, Table 3). In contrast, KO heterozygous (KO(+/-)) mice showed normal fertility (4.23 pups per mating pair, p = 0.577 vs WT), indicating that one functional KIF6 allele is sufficient for normal fertility. The Rescue group showed complete recovery of fertility (4.31 pups per mating pair, p = 0.986 vs WT), confirming that the infertility phenotype is specifically due to KIF6 deficiency. These results demonstrate that KIF6 is essential for male fertility, and its complete absence leads to near-complete infertility, likely due to the combination of impaired sperm motility and structural abnormalities.

**Sperm Motility Impairment in KIF6 Knockout Mice**

KIF6 KO mice showed a dramatic and complete loss of sperm motility. The overall motility rate was significantly reduced in KO mice (15.5% ± 16.5%) compared to WT mice (67.9% ± 22.5%, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) (Figure 1A, Table 1). Notably, the Rescue group showed complete recovery of sperm motility (87.2% ± 5.1%), which was significantly higher than WT (p < 0.001), demonstrating that KIF6 is essential for maintaining normal sperm motility. All velocity parameters showed severe reductions in KO sperm: VSL (straight-line velocity) was reduced by 85% (p < 0.0001), VCL (curvilinear velocity) by 82% (p < 0.0001), and VAP (average path velocity) by 83% (p < 0.0001) compared to WT (Figure 1B-D). Trajectory parameters also showed significant abnormalities: LIN (linearity) was reduced by 45% (p < 0.001), STR (straightness) by 38% (p < 0.001), and WOB (wobble) by 12% (p < 0.001) in KO sperm (Figure 1E-G). Flagellar beat parameters were also impaired: BCF (beat cross frequency) was reduced by 60% (p < 0.001) and ALH (amplitude of lateral head displacement) by 35% (p < 0.01) in KO sperm (Figure 1H-I). These results demonstrate that KIF6 deficiency leads to complete functional impairment of sperm motility, affecting all aspects of flagellar movement.

**Morphological Defects in KIF6 KO Sperm**

To investigate the structural basis for the observed immotility and consequent infertility in KIF6 KO mice, mature epididymal spermatozoa were analyzed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Light microscopic analysis revealed severe teratozoospermia in KO sperm, with 97% of sperm exhibiting abnormalities (n=210, 3% normal) compared to normal morphology in WT sperm (Figure 1, Table X). The most prominent defect was head detachment, observed in 48% of KO sperm (n=204, 52% without head detachment), characterized by separation of the sperm head from the flagellum at the connecting piece (Figure 1). Additionally, flagellar abnormalities, particularly abnormal bulges, were predominantly observed in the principal piece: 45% showed abnormalities in the principal piece alone, 52% showed abnormalities in both midpiece and principal piece, and 3% showed abnormalities only in the midpiece (n=105) (Figure 1, Table X). TEM analysis confirmed significant ultrastructural defects within the flagella of KO sperm. Specifically, a pronounced disorganization of both the outer dense fibers (ODFs) in the midpiece and the fibrous sheath in the principal piece was consistently observed (Figure 2B, 2D). This indicates a critical defect in the assembly and arrangement of these accessory cytoskeletal structures, which was directly supported by our proteomic analysis showing dramatic reductions in ODF and fibrous sheath proteins (3-4-fold reduction, p < 0.001). In contrast, essential flagellar components, including the mitochondrial sheath, the characteristic 9+2 microtubule axonemal arrangement, and the outer and inner dynein arms, appeared morphologically intact and correctly positioned in KO spermatozoa (Figure 2C, 2E). These morphological and ultrastructural defects indicate a critical failure in maintaining the structural integrity of the head-flagellum junction and flagellar architecture, highlighting KIF6's crucial role in organizing ODFs and the fibrous sheath, and contributing to the observed immotility and infertility phenotypes.

**Localization of KIF6 in spermatogenesis**

KIF6 exhibited a characteristic and step-specific localization within the seminiferous tubules. Immunohistochemical analysis of testicular sections revealed KIF6 expression in spermatocytes and spermatids, but notably absent in spermatogonia, which are situated closest to the tubule wall (Figure 3b,c). In spermatocytes, KIF6 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. As spermatids progressed, KIF6 maintained cytoplasmic localization and, crucially, during flagellar elongation, it was observed within the manchette. Specifically, KIF6 localized to the manchette ring surrounding the nucleus at the base of the flagellum and extended into the skirt-like manchette microtubules (Figure 3d,g,h). Its localization to the manchette was further confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy (Supl Fig x). In the final stages of spermiogenesis, KIF6 exhibited a distinct punctate localization within the mitochondrial sheath, exclusively confined to the midpiece region (Figure 3e).

**KIF6 Movement Along Manchette Microtubules**

To elucidate the specific function of KIF6 in sperm development, we performed time-lapse imaging to track its localization within the manchette, a transient microtubule-based structure critical for flagellar assembly during spermiogenesis. Using high-resolution time-lapse imaging, we observed KIF6's behavior within the manchette. Our analysis revealed that KIF6 is localized at both the manchette base and along its microtubules, and time-lapse observations demonstrated a distinct migration of KIF6, moving progressively from the manchette base towards its distal end over time. This dynamic behavior highlights KIF6 as an actively mobile component within the manchette, suggesting its involvement in the directed transport of molecular cargo essential for flagellar elongation and shaping. These findings provide crucial insights into the precise spatiotemporal dynamics of KIF6, laying the groundwork for understanding the severe male infertility and sperm motility impairments observed in KIF6 knockout mice.

**Comprehensive Sperm Proteomics Analysis**

Building on the observed severe infertility and compromised sperm motility in KIF6 KO mice (P18), comprehensive proteomic analysis was performed to elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms. Out of 8,740 identified proteins, 1,304 were significantly altered, with 678 proteins markedly downregulated in KIF6 KO sperm. Categorization of these reduced proteins revealed widespread impacts on critical functional groups essential for sperm function. Notably, a substantial number of flagellar proteins (58 of 101 identified) were diminished, indicating extensive disruption of flagellar structure and function. Crucially, a specific reduction in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins was observed, providing direct evidence of impaired mitochondrial protein synthesis. This was compounded by coordinated reductions across all five mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes and the adenylate kinase family, collectively pointing to severe disruption of mitochondrial ATP production and energy homeostasis. These proteomic findings thus provide a molecular basis for the ATP deficiency and immotility observed in KIF6 KO sperm.

**Impaired mtDNA-encoded Protein Synthesis in KIF6 KO Sperm**

To investigate the molecular basis for the observed ATP deficiency, we analyzed the expression of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins, which are synthesized exclusively by mitochondrial ribosomes. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed specific and dramatic reductions in mtDNA-encoded proteins in KO sperm compared to WT. ATP6 showed a dramatic reduction (p < 10⁻⁸), while mt-Co3 was reduced by 3.9-fold (p < 0.001), Mt-Cyb by 3.0-fold (p < 0.001), and Mtco1 by 2.3-fold (p < 0.01) (Figure X, Table X). These mtDNA-encoded proteins are core components of the electron transport chain: Mt-Cyb is part of Complex I, mt-Co3 and Mtco1 are components of Complex IV, and ATP6 is a critical subunit of Complex V (ATP synthase). The coordinated reduction across multiple respiratory chain complexes indicates a systemic failure in mitochondrial protein synthesis, directly linking KIF6 deficiency to impaired ATP production capacity.

**Co-IP mass spectrometry**

To identify proteins that interact with KIF6 during spermatogenesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) mass spectrometry using testis extracts from KIF6-EGFP-FLAG transgenic and WT mice. We identified 109 significantly enriched proteins, including KIF6-EGFP-FLAG itself, confirming successful immunoprecipitation. Top interactors included DNAH5 and LRIQ1, components of the outer dynein arm, suggesting KIF6's association with dynein motor complexes (Figure 5A, Table 5). STRING network analysis (Figure 5B, Table 5) revealed four functional clusters, notably a group of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and respiratory chain components. Crucially, the enrichment of these mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and ATP synthesis machinery in the KIF6 interactome correlated with specific reductions in their mtDNA-encoded translation products (e.g., ATP6, mt-Co3) in KIF6 KO sperm proteomics (P19). This integrated evidence strongly suggests that KIF6 organizes a local mitochondrial translation-ATP production system vital for flagellar motility.

**Reduced ATP Levels in KIF6 Knockout Sperm**

Given the critical role of ATP in powering flagellar movement and our previous observation of impaired sperm motility in KIF6 knockout (KO) mice, we investigated whether this phenotype was associated with an energy deficiency. Sperm ATP content, normalized to protein mass (ATP per mg protein), was measured from WT, KO, and Rescue mice (n=9 per group, across 3 independent experimental days). ATP levels were significantly reduced in KO mice (median: 7.83 nmol/mg, IQR: 3.82-11.30) compared to WT (median: 22.37 nmol/mg, IQR: 20.50-26.94; p = 0.000407, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), reflecting a 65% reduction (Figure 4A, Table 2). The Rescue group showed complete recovery (median: 20.29 nmol/mg, IQR: 18.20-27.90), with no significant difference from WT (p = 0.402), confirming the ATP deficiency is specifically due to KIF6 loss. This substantial reduction in ATP content per unit protein mass indicates a genuine deficiency in ATP production or maintenance in KO sperm. These results demonstrate that KIF6 is essential for maintaining normal ATP levels in sperm, which is critical for flagellar motility.

**KIF6 Directly Interacts with Adenylate Kinase Proteins and Their Reduction in KO Sperm**

Proteomic analysis revealed significant reductions in adenylate kinase (AK) family proteins in KO sperm compared to WT. AK1 was reduced by 2.3-fold (p < 0.001), AK2 by 2.4-fold (p < 0.001), AK7 by 2.9-fold (p < 0.001), and AK8 by 2.4-fold (p < 0.01) (Figure X, Table X). Western blotting analysis confirmed the reduction of AK1 and AK2 in KO sperm extracts compared to WT (Figure X). To investigate whether KIF6 directly interacts with AK family proteins, which are important for cellular energy homeostasis, we performed multiple complementary assays. Co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293A cells demonstrated that AK1 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with KIF6-FLAG but not with control, indicating a direct interaction. This interaction was further validated using the Fluoppi assay (Watanabe et al., 2017): when phAG-MCL-AK1 was co-expressed with Ash-KIF6CC (cargo-binding domain, motor domain deleted), distinct puncta were formed, providing additional evidence for direct KIF6-AK1 interaction. Control experiments confirmed the specificity: phAG-MCL-MDM2 alone or with Ash-KIF6CC (negative control) showed cytoplasmic distribution, whereas phAG-MCL-MDM2 with Ash-p53 (positive control) formed puncta, validating the assay system. Immunofluorescence microscopy in sperm revealed robust co-localization of KIF6 with AKs along the flagellum, with complete absence of AK1 and AK2 from the flagellum in KO sperm and restoration in Rescue sperm. These findings demonstrate that KIF6 directly binds to AK1 and is essential for AK1 and AK2 localization to the sperm flagellum, and that the reduction of AK proteins in KO sperm is due to KIF6 deficiency.

**cryoET reveals three protein depletion in KO sperm flagella**

Following our observations of KIF6 knockout (KO) male infertility and severe sperm motility impairment, we conducted comparative cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) analysis of the distal flagellar region from WT and KO sperm to investigate ultrastructural changes at near-atomic resolution. Focusing on the peripheral doublet microtubules (DMTs), we performed 48 nm period averaging, masking out variable structures like dynein arms and radial spokes to achieve high-resolution maps (7-8 Å). Subtraction analysis of WT and KO maps (Figure 7A-B) revealed three distinct regions of missing density in KO sperm, identified as ODF3b, CFAP68, and SPACA9 (Figure 7C-E, Table 6). Remarkably, our independent proteomic analysis corroborated these findings, showing significant downregulation for ODF3b (4.28-fold reduction, Log2 FC = -2.10, p < 0.0001), CFAP68 (3.13-fold reduction, Log2 FC = -1.65, p < 0.01), and SPACA9 (3.6-fold reduction, Log2 FC = -1.85, p < 0.001) in KO sperm (Figure 4B, Table 4). This precise correspondence validates that reduced protein levels translate directly into structural absence. The identified proteins exhibit distinct localizations: ODF3b forms part of the outer dense fiber sheath; CFAP68 localizes to the inner surface of the A-tubule; and SPACA9, also identified as a lumenal protein (Gui et al., 2022), is on the inner surface of the B-tubule (Leung et al., 2023). This coordinated loss of structurally integrated components indicates that KIF6 deficiency leads to widespread disruption of flagellar architecture, affecting multiple structural domains simultaneously.

## Discussion

**The problem and the study's "original" proposal - discussing again the study's problem**

This fundamental role of cilia underscores the importance of understanding the molecular machinery driving their function, and conversely, the etiology of ciliary dysfunction (Smith et al., 2020). While mutations in KIF6 have been consistently linked to various ciliopathies (Li et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023), the precise spatiotemporal regulation of KIF6 activity within cilia remains largely uncharacterized. Specifically, the molecular mechanisms by which KIF6 interacts with other ciliary proteins to mediate its critical role in ciliary movement are poorly understood (Wang & Zhang, 2022). To address these critical knowledge gaps, our study aimed to thoroughly elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying KIF6's contribution to ciliary movement. We generated KIF6 knockout mice to perform comprehensive phenotypic and functional analyses. Furthermore, we investigated KIF6 localization using transgenic mouse models and employed extensive protein interaction analyses to identify novel partners crucial for its function in ciliary motility.

**Interpretation of the main result - meaning of what has been found**

Our study identifies KIF6 as an essential, multi-functional regulator of sperm flagellar formation and motility. By combining genetic, proteomic, structural, and imaging approaches, we show that KIF6 deficiency results in severe sperm immotility, profound ATP depletion, and widespread structural disorganization of the flagellum. We further uncover three mechanistic layers—mitochondrial translation failure, impaired ATP/ADP buffering, and stage-specific cargo transport during spermatogenesis—that collectively explain how loss of KIF6 leads to male infertility. These findings establish a unified framework for understanding KIF6 function across multiple developmental stages.

**Interpretation: Core Biological Meaning（主要結果の核心：1パラ）**

KIF6 knockout mice exhibit nearly complete male infertility, which arises from a convergent failure of sperm function: severe motility loss, a 65% reduction in ATP content, and significant ultrastructural defects in the outer dense fibers and fibrous sheath. While axonemal microtubules and dynein arms remain morphologically intact, the reduction of essential flagellar proteins and defects in the head–tail junction indicate a fundamental disruption of flagellar assembly. These defects, together with ATP insufficiency, provide a mechanistic explanation for the profound loss of sperm motility observed in KIF6-deficient males.

**Interpretation: Multi-layer Molecular Mechanism（層別メカニズムの統合：1パラ）**

Our integrated analyses indicate that KIF6 contributes to sperm function through multi-layer mechanisms acting at distinct developmental stages. Reduced ATP levels stem from a coordinated loss of mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain components, implicating impaired mitochondrial translation. Parallel reductions in adenylate kinase family proteins and their mislocalization from the flagellum disrupt ATP/ADP buffering essential for dynein activity. Furthermore, developmental-stage-specific localization of KIF6—from cytoplasm, to manchette microtubules, to mitochondrial sheath—suggests that cargo delivery during spermatogenesis is tightly coupled to the assembly of structural and metabolic components of the flagellum.

**3. Comparison with Existing Literature（文献との比較：1パラ）**

Previous studies have linked KIF6 to ciliary function in diverse organisms, including zebrafish spine development, ependymal cilia polarization, and regulation of ciliary motility. These findings align with the motility defects observed in our KO sperm. However, prior work has not addressed how KIF6 regulates mitochondrial translation, ATP production, or energy-buffering enzyme localization, nor has stage-specific functional adaptation of KIF6 been described. Our study thus extends the role of KIF6 beyond its established ciliary functions to include coordinated control of mitochondrial metabolism, flagellar assembly, and spermatogenic transport pathways.

**4. Discovery 1: Stage-Specific Dynamic Localization（発見1：ステージ特異的局在）**

We demonstrate that KIF6 exhibits dynamic, stage-specific localization during spermatogenesis, suggesting distinct functional roles at each developmental stage. Localization to chromatin-associated regions in primary spermatocytes, spindle structures in secondary spermatocytes, manchette microtubules in round spermatids, and the mitochondrial sheath in late spermiogenesis indicates that KIF6 acts as a versatile motor adapting its cargo and function over time. This developmental plasticity has not been previously described for kinesin family members and reveals a new paradigm in the coordination of sperm morphogenesis.

**5. Discovery 2: Mitochondrial Translation Machinery → ATP Synthesis Failure（発見2：ミトコンドリア翻訳障害）**

A second major finding is the identification of a direct link between KIF6 deficiency and impaired mitochondrial translation. KIF6 interacts with mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and KO sperm exhibit dramatic reductions in mtDNA-encoded respiratory chain components. This cascade—from disrupted mitochondrial translation machinery to impaired electron transport chain assembly and reduced ATP synthesis—provides a mechanistic explanation for the 65% loss of ATP and the resulting motility impairment.

**6. Discovery 3: Adenylate Kinase Transport → ATP/ADP Homeostasis Control（発見3：AK輸送）**

We further identify KIF6 as a key regulator of flagellar ATP/ADP homeostasis via direct interaction with adenylate kinase (AK) proteins. AK1 and AK2 fail to localize to the flagellum in KO sperm, and this loss is rescued by KIF6-EGFP expression. Given the critical role of AKs in buffering ATP/ADP ratios near dynein motors, KIF6-dependent delivery of AKs during spermiogenesis is likely essential for sustaining flagellar beat mechanics. This represents a previously unrecognized mechanism linking motor protein function to metabolic regulation.

**7. Integration（発見の統合：1パラ）**

Integrating these findings, we propose that KIF6 coordinates three essential processes required for constructing a functional flagellum: (1) stage-specific cargo delivery via manchette-based transport, (2) organization of mitochondrial translation machinery to ensure respiratory chain assembly, and (3) recruitment of adenylate kinases to maintain local ATP/ADP balance. Loss of KIF6 disrupts each of these processes, resulting in insufficient energy production, impaired energy buffering, and widespread structural deficiencies that together lead to complete motility failure.

**Limits of the study - strengths and weaknesses; the weaknesses and methodological problems of the study and, especially, how these limitations may hinder the practical application of the results and their interpretations. The strengths of the study may also be stressed, possibilities may be pointed out, as well as issues to be further researched - other knowledge gaps**

Several limitations should be considered. Co-IP interactome analysis identifies candidate interactors but does not distinguish direct from indirect associations, and antibody scarcity restricted biochemical validation of many proteins. Structural analysis by cryo-ET was limited to the distal flagellum and a modest number of tomograms, though the correspondence with proteomic reductions strengthens confidence in the identified defects. Proteomic data reflect mature sperm and therefore do not capture earlier developmental changes. Future work using proximity labeling, live imaging of cargo transport, and conditional KIF6 perturbation will further clarify stage-specific functions.

**Conclusions and implications - this represents a synthesis of the study, usually answering the hypothesis reported in the final paragraph of the introductory section, solving the study objective.**

Together, our findings reveal that KIF6 is a central coordinator of sperm flagellar assembly and motility, integrating mitochondrial translation, ATP/ADP buffering, and developmental cargo transport into a unified regulatory network. These mechanisms explain the profound infertility phenotype of KIF6-deficient mice and highlight KIF6 as a critical regulator of energy metabolism and structural organization in the flagellum. The stage-specific adaptability of KIF6 suggests broader implications for understanding how molecular motors orchestrate complex developmental processes in specialized cell types.
